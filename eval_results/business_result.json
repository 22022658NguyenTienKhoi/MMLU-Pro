The phrase \"There are two main issues associated with _____ sizing\" suggests that we are talking about either increasing (up) or decreasing (down) the size of something, likely the workforce.\n2. The first blank should be filled with either \"up\" or \"down.\" Given the context of redundancy and layoffs, \"down\" (downsizing) is the appropriate term.\n3. The next part, \"_______ is a key issue as due to the information policy of the corporation it can be argued that employees have a right to know if they are being made redundant,\" suggests that the issue is related to communication or involvement of employees in the process.\n4. The third blank, \"_______ is a second issue, particularly the ________ package that employees receive when laid off,\" indicates that the second issue is related to the compensation or benefits provided to employees when they are laid off.\n\nLet's match these points with the options provided:\n\n- Option A: Down, Autonomy, Remuneration, Benefit\n- Option B: Down, Involvement, Independence, Benefit\n- Option C: Up, Independence, Involvement, Benefit\n- Option D: Down, Privacy, Autonomy, Benefit\n- Option E: Up, Involvement, Autonomy, Compensation\n- Option F: Down, Independence, Autonomy, Compensation\n- Option G: Up, Involvement, Remuneration, Severance\n- Option H: Up, Privacy, Remuneration, Severance\n- Option I: Up, Autonomy, Remuneration, Compensation\n- Option J: Down, Involvement, Remuneration, Compensation\n\nGiven the context:\n- \"Down\" is the correct term for the first blank.\n- \"Involvement\" fits the context of employees having a right to know about redundancies.\n- \"Remuneration\" and \"Compensation\" both fit the context of the package employees receive when laid off, but \"Compensation\" is more commonly used in this context.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nThe answer is (J)."}]
